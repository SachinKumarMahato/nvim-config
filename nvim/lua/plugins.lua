	-- NOTE: Plugins can be added with a link (or for a github repo: 'owner/repo' link).
	"tpope/vim-sleuth", -- Detect tabstop and shiftwidth automatically

	-- NOTE: Plugins can also be added by using a table,
	-- with the first argument being the link and the following
	-- keys can be used to configure plugin behavior/loading/etc.
	--
	-- Use `opts = {}` to force a plugin to be loaded.
	--
	--  This is equivalent to:
	--    require('Comment').setup({})



	-- "gc" to comment visual regions/lines
	{ "numToStr/Comment.nvim", opts = {} },

	-- Here is a more advanced example where we pass configuration
	-- options to `gitsigns.nvim`. This is equivalent to the following lua:
	--    require('gitsigns').setup({ ... })
	--


	-- NOTE: Plugins can also be configured to run lua code when they are loaded.
	--
	-- This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
	-- lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
	--
	-- For example, in the following configuration, we use:
	--  event = 'VimEnter'
	--
	-- which loads which-key before all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be
	-- normal autocommands events (`:help autocmd-events`).
	--
	-- Then, because we use the `config` key, the configuration only runs
	-- after the plugin has been loaded:
	--  config = function() ... end



	-- NOTE: Plugins can specify dependencies.
	--
	-- The dependencies are proper plugin specifications as well - anything
	-- you do for a plugin at the top level, you can do for a dependency.
	--
	-- Use the `dependencies` key to specify the dependencies of a particular plugin

	







	{ -- You can easily change to a different colorscheme.
		-- Change the name of the colorscheme plugin below, and then

			require("mini.surround").setup()

			-- Simple and easy statusline.
			--  You could remove this setup call if you don't like it,
			--  and try some other statusline plugin
			local statusline = require("mini.statusline")
			statusline.setup()

	-- NOTE: Next step on your Neovim journey: Add/Configure additional plugins for kickstart
	--
	--  Here are some example plugins that I've included in the kickstart repository.
	--  Uncomment any of the lines below to enable them (you will need to restart nvim).
	--
	-- require 'kickstart.plugins.debug',
	-- require 'kickstart.plugins.indent_line',

	-- NOTE: The import below can automatically add your own plugins, configuration, etc from `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua`
	--    This is the easiest way to modularize your config.
	--
	--  Uncomment the following line and add your plugins to `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua` to get going.
	--    For additional information, see `:help lazy.nvim-lazy.nvim-structuring-your-plugins`
	-- { import = 'custom.plugins' },
